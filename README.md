# Module-1Challange
 This is going to include the material for the module 1 challange
 In this assignment, we had to create a more streamline code. 

 The changes that i made were to further enhance the fluidity of the code and allow for changes to happen quicker. 

 The most prolific change that i felt needed changing was the .root block that i added. I noticed that there were a few sections in the css file that 
 had to do with color. Considering that websites change often, I found that being able to change the color attribute would come in handy instead
 of hard coding all the colors individually. 

 Another change that i tried to make was the borders. The benefits section was bogged down with repetative code that hard coded a bunch of spacing and color in the same block. I was able to change it and fashion it to be close to the original, but i feel as if a little more editing was required to make it perfect. 

 I also added alts to all the pics in the event that a browser was unable to load them.
